### The Importance of Motivation in a Company

Today, I talked with someone I really respect, and it made me think about what's most important for a company. Is it the skills, abilities, or loyalty of their employees? I believe that leading people by their hearts is crucial. No matter how skilled they are, motivation is key. It drives them to work towards the greater good. Of course, a competitive salary is important, but treating employees well usually has a bigger impact. When employees feel truly valued, they give their best to the company. On the other hand, feeling undervalued is obvious. A breach of trust between the company and its employees can lead to serious long-term problems that need to be addressed.
